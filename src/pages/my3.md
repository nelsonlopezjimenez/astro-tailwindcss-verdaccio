# Module 2 - week 4.17 (cont)

We created a Astro-based website. It consists of homepage, and some other pages (layout pages). We installed Tailwind, Tailwindcss, integration to node, and manually edited configuration files. 
we discussed Astro versus other JavaScript frameworks. 

We'll be using Tailwind to build a layout that is responsive and handles dark and bright mode. We'll learn how to use Astro components to compose the HTML, server side, using JavaScript imports. Also, we'll learn how to create dynamic routes and how to use content collections to build the app.

# Tips from Flavio Copes

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è TIP: Tailwind is called a ‚Äúutility framework‚Äù. If you already know another framework like Bootstrap, Tailwind is similar but kind of different. Instead of providing you with more CSS classes, like .container or .btn-primary that do not tell you exactly what they do, you have what it‚Äôs called utility classes. Like .text-right or .text-left. They tell you precisely what they do. And they just do one thing. In this case, they move the text to the right or left. This is just an example. There are many more of those classes, each applying a single property of CSS rather than many at once as happens with Bootstrap.
