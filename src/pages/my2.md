# Module 2 - week 4.17

Now we are going to create a Astro-based website. It consists of homepage, blog, projects page, etc. We'll be using Tailwind to build a layout that is responsive and handles dark and bright mode. We'll learn how to use Astro components to compose the HTML, server side, using JavaScript imports. Also, we'll learn how to create dynamic routes and how to use content collections to build the app.

## Introduction

In the previous module we talked about what the app will do, we defined the data model, we installed PocketBase, explored it, we created the projects and tasks collections to store data.

In this module we'll introduce Astro that will be our backend framework. We'll create a homepage and a blog where we'll post all the news about our app.

## Goals

- how to use Astro to create a website
- how to use Tailwind CSS to style a web page
- how to use responsive design to build a page that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices
- how to design for dark and bright mode
- how to use Astro components to compose HTML, server-side, using JavaScript imports
- how to create dynamic routes
- how to build a blog in Astro using content collections.

## What is Astro

Astro is a backend framework written in JavaScript (Typescript actually) that you use to build websites and web applications.

What is its role in our applicataion? 

how does it paly with PocketBase?

PocketBase will:

- host data in a SQLite database
- provide model around the database, taking care of things like relations and authorizations
- provide a JavaScript API to query and insert data
- provide tools for authentication
- provide file uploads functionality

Astro will:

- generate the HTML of the website
- render the blog from markdown pages
- generate the HTML of the signup and login forms
- handle aunthenticated requests for users that are logged in
- provide a customized dashboard to each user, gathering from PocketBase the user-specific data
- handle all the HTTP requests the users will generate by clicking around the app in the browser, to create projects, delete projects, add tasks, etc. 

PocketBase is the database server. Astro is the backend server (or application server). 

We'll use Astro on the backend side of our stack because:

- I really like it, compared with other backend JavaScript frameworks, for instance express
- It has a simpler mental model: everything is 'spits out' is HTML
- it plays well with the Web Platform defaults. Do you want to use JavaSript? you add a &lt;script> tag. Do you want to use CSS? you add a &lt;style> tag.
- we can generate the HTML using a syntax similar to JSX (JavaScript EXtensible format used in React for instance)
- it can do both static page rendering and server rendering
- it works with htmx (we wil see...) thanks to its ability to generate HTML partials (and not just full HTML pages)
- it evolves to become more complex, but always it starts as a simple backend tool
- being JavaScript, you can use any NodeJS API or npm package you may need.

 But What Is a Framework?

 NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment for running JavaScript applications outside the browser. It is asynchronous. It is event-driven. 

 With around 50,000 open source packages available through npm (Node Package Manager), it offers quite a variety of tools and option in fullstack web development

 So a framework. Nodejs frameworks are a set of libraries, templates, and tools built on top of the Node environment. They offer a basic structure for applications including routes, middleware, and templates that streamline the development process. 

 Why use NodeJS frameworks?

 It provides so called syntactic sugar (easier, simpler looking syntax).

 What does it mean?

 Look at the code snippet below that showcases the displaying of a &lt;h2> tag on the home route using vanilla JavaScript and Express. 

```
//NodeJS
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
    res.write('<html>');
    res.write('<head><title>Best NodeJS Frameworks</title><head>');
    res.write('<body><h2>Hello from the Ably Blog</h2></body>');
    res.write('</html>');
    res.end();
});


// Express
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
 
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('<h2>Hello from the Ably Blog</h2>');
});
```
In NodeJS, we create an http server, use setHeader to manually set the response content type and write all the required HTML tags to be able to display the &lt;h2> tag.

In Express, we only need to just send the &lt;h2> tag as a response. 

Express is a minimalistic web framework to simplify the backend application development with a robust set of features including routing, middleware, error handling, and templating

NestJS is a framework that uses both JavasCript and Typescript. It follows a modular architecture. The use of modules ensures maintainability and reusability across various parts of the application.

## Installing Astro Locally

Your workspace should be in either ~/Desktop or ~/Documents folders. The tilde refers to your home location.

Inside you should have a folder ~/Documents/QUARTER_3/dev

cd into ~/Documents/QUARTER_3/dev folder and run 
```
npm create astro@latest
```
You may (or may not) be able to run it on your laptops. It depends on several factors. I will show you how it run when connected to the Internet, where you have access to the most updated versions of all packages and process. If you cannot do it in your laptops, I will show the alternative ways to install it in your laptops.

But first the installation with access to the Internet in pictures or video.  

![](here/goes/video)

Now in the terminal (within VS Code or not), you can run
```
npm run dev
```

Got to http://localhost:4321, you should see

## About VS Code configuration

Everyone has his/her preferences with code style. You can select your own preferences. Some of the examples are taken from github. If you want your code to match them, use Prettier, a style formatting extension for VS Code. I am not sure if you have it yet. 

In any case, go to the VS Code Settings and enable 'Editor: Format On Save'. The code will auto-format every time you save a file (or automatically if you have auto-save).

Also, you may modify Prettier settings 'Semi' and 'Single Attribute Per Line.

## About Typescript

It is basically JavaScript, but with types support, so we could say 'we expect this value to be a string (an not a number)' or 'this is a number (and not a string)' which JavaScript does not provide out of the box. In this project you will use a lot of inferred types, which means there is a minimal amount of type annotations in some critical places, and then TypeScript fill figure out automatically the rest.

This approach has few advantages:

- code completion in VS Code: a nice development experience or DX that only types can provide
- the TypeScript compiler can warn about possible issues related to types, for example, using a property not defined on a type, or passing the wrong type to a function.


## Overview of the starter Astro site

The page with the 'Welcome to Astro' title in it was generated by Astro, through the file 
```
src/pages/index.astro
```

In Astro components the part between three dashes '---' is server-side code with the import required. After that, there's the HTML rendered in the browser.

The HTML defined in this Astro page component is almost the same you see in the browser, except for the doctype and the head tags, and the Vite (the build tool used by Astro) script which is used in development for hot reloading / automatic refres of the page when you change something in your editor.

Look at the Elements panel of the browser DevTools

## Astro vs other JS frameworks

Astro run server side and generates simple HTML by default. There is no complexity introduced by stuff like virtual DOM, client-side hydration that some frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte introduce.

The biggest difference is that those frameworks are heavy JavaScript applications running inside the browser that drive the user interface.

So the user load a page, some JavaScript is loaded, the JavaScript determines what appears on the page. The so called 'SPA (Single Page App) approach'.

Also, client-side navigation is all controlled by JavaScript.

With Astro, we generate the HTML server side, the browser renders the HTML. Period.

It is how the web worked for decades, before 'modern JS frameworks' started to reinvent a lot of patterns and introduced client-side navigation.

Click a link? The browser makes a request to Astro, it generates new HTML and the browser renders it

Most of the frameworks (React, Svelte, ...) are now trying to go 'back to the server' but the solution for them is far from the simple, bare-bones approach that Astro went into from day 1.

All while not limiting you to use a frontend framework if you want, thanks to its 'islands architecture'. We will pair Astro with an incredible tool (htmx), to get to a level of interactivity that people nowadays link to using a fully featured frontend framework like React.

The combination of the two will let us create SPA-grade applications with a simplicity that will make you wonder why are people dealing with a heavy frontend framework at all. This is a question on one of Flavio Copes blog. And I think the answer lies in the mobile vs non-mobile devices usage.

# Tips from Flavio Copes

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è TIP: Tailwind is called a ‚Äúutility framework‚Äù. If you already know another framework like Bootstrap, Tailwind is similar but kind of different. Instead of providing you with more CSS classes, like .container or .btn-primary that do not tell you exactly what they do, you have what it‚Äôs called utility classes. Like .text-right or .text-left. They tell you precisely what they do. And they just do one thing. In this case, they move the text to the right or left. This is just an example. There are many more of those classes, each applying a single property of CSS rather than many at once as happens with Bootstrap.
